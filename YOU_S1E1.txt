you are not here ogled
which one will you buy
you sound apologetic
you murmur your first word to me
it's an epidemic
people are disappointing, are not they?
I had to be sure you are safe
I obliged
I was concerned
I plan on asking you about this quality
why don't we spend the day together tomorrow
By 10 you'r at campus
your wealthy girlfriends are just now woken up and nothing better to do than plan their next pointless yet Instagrammable night
you have questionable take in friends.
why don't you just let me loan you some cash? I keep telling you it's nothing.
Sounds like condescending.
underneath it all
illicit
I am drowning in work
you can borrow it when I'm done
The most valuable things in life are usually the most helpless
when we live together, your place won't be a pigsty
Did you move here to be something?
me neither
Thankyou you for sobering up and saving for my life
Everyone needs someone
This gonna takes us next level, what time do you think we will meet?
you gotta be precise
when the door chimes

"Engine engine number nine
on the new york transit line
if your girl fall on the track
pick her up, pick her up, pick her up."
